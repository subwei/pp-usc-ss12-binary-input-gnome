Binary Caribou uses a slightly modified version of Morse Code.

In normal Morse Code, all punctuation requires 6 dots/dashes to reach (for instance, "!" is -.-.--) because really, punctuation isn't that important to convey in speech (and in general, Morse Code is used to replace speech). The thing is, punctuation is important on keyboards!

As such, we have replaced some of the less useful 4- or 5-dot/dash characters (namely, the accented ones - characters with umlauts, etc.) with punctuation characters. This is, admittedly, doing to Morse Code what Internet Explorer does to browsers - but we're using Morse Code in a very different manner than Samuel Morse intended, so we have to accept that we need to change it in order to make it more useful for our purpose. Following is a binary tree of morse code with our changes highlighted in red:
